			The main goal of Bras Ouverts – Open Arms (BOOA) is to establish a sustainably financed school that provides free education in Ouidah, Benin. Since women and girls are especially vulnerable to suffering as a result of displacement and poverty, a central tenet of BOOA’s mission is to prioritize the needs of females in the community through education and empowerment.
